  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Benjamin Franklin was born on January 17th, 1706, in Boston, the fifteenth child in the family of an English immigrant soapmaker. His father had modest means but encouraged Benjamin’s natural curiosity and love of learning.

From the age of ten, young Benjamin began working for his father. Although he was not passionate about this work, he remained a dedicated reader. He often borrowed books and sometimes managed to read an entire book in a single night. His choice of reading was extraordinary; at the age of twelve, he read works by John Locke, and later explored Plutarch and Daniel Defoe.

By the age of fifteen, Franklin began writing his own articles and secretly published them in his brother’s newspaper. The articles brought success to the publication, but when his brother discovered the author, he reacted negatively. After their disagreement, Benjamin left Boston.

Before turning twenty, Franklin moved to London, where he worked as a printer and published his first book. Upon returning to America, he founded a philosophical club that met weekly to discuss literature, practice public speaking, and improve moral development. This club later inspired the creation of a public library.</p>
